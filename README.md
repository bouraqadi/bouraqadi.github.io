# [Noury Bouraqadi](https://nootrix.com/about)
I am a software developer, maker, repair hobbyist, environment/technology/robots lover. 
For development, I mostly use [Pharo Smalltalk](https://pharo.org) and JavaScript through [PharoJS](https://pharojs.org).

## PharoJS
[PharoJS](https://pharojs.org) allows to develop (code & test) in Pharo, applications that ultimately run on JavaScript.
Thanks to GitHub actions and SmalltalkCI we can deploy client-side applications to GitHub pages. 

Here is a simple example with a random number generator:
- [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/bouraqadi/PjRandomNumber)
- [Generated GitHub Page](https://bouraqadi.github.io/PjRandomNumber)
